abilities idea: instead of color determining shape, the color is an identifier of what ability you have.
the shapes are now entirely unrelated to the color
abilities are activated by using the left/right arrow keys 
(being called forward and back due to being reversed when on the opposite side)
back will always taunt, forward will use your ability

press forward to bump the ball vertically and slow it down a bit

light-green:

pink:
press forward to make the ball come to you, maybe increasing speed if already headed towards you

dark-blue:
press forward to enable gravity on the ball until next hit

orange:
