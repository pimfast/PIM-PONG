10 unique options using different shapes and "deflector types" (can be hard, normal, breakable, or soft)

white:
default shape normal deflecting capabilities

light-blue:
longer but farther forward

light-green:
longer but with holes in it

pink:
a bit longer but softer

red:
harder deflect and farther forward

yellow:
like a sideways 'w' or crown type shape, same total length as white

dark-blue:
hamburger shape so like two lines but it's soft but you can build it up by like passing it to yourself

orange:
three seperated deflectors like foosball goalies

dark-green:
suuuuper wide with suuuuper wide gaps

purple:
huge with three layers but almost entirely breakable except for one hard deflecting part in the middle

10 MORE IDEAS IF I WANNA DO THEM:
gold:
just smaller. and golden. aawweessoommee..
nvm it just flips the paddle sideways. and it's golden. aawweessoommee..

jester:
it's literally just 1 square but it only needs 1 point to win

rainbow:
makes the ball rainbow upon hit. rainbow balls go wacky

blood:
starts so huge it can touch both sides at once but every hit makes it irreversibly smaller

slot machine:
every hit spins the slots (itself) lucky winners get powerful shots and a 777 shrinks the opponent

hands:
two hands on the top and bottom of the paddle. grabbing the ball makes the other hand toss a faster one

gun:
paddle gets replaced with a reticle you freely move around your half of the screen. auto shoots balls.

pinball:
become two pinball flippers that can be flipped by pressing the buttons. includes a bumper in the middle

dance dance revolution:
you get a wall that goes from hard to normal to soft to nothing depending on how well you're doing in ddr

black:
normal but completely impossible to see
