shapes:
10 unique options using different shapes and "deflector types" (can be hard, normal, breakable, or soft)

shape01 (white):
default shape normal deflecting capabilities

shape02 (light-blue):
longer but farther forward

shape03 (light-green):
longer but with holes in it

shape04 (pink):
a bit longer but softer

shape05 (red):
harder deflect and farther forward

shape06 (yellow):
like a sideways 'w' or crown type shape, same total length as white

shape07 (dark-blue):
hamburger shape so like two lines but it's soft but you can build it up by like passing it to yourself

shape08 (orange):
three seperated deflectors like foosball goalies

shape09 (dark-green):
suuuuper wide with suuuuper wide gaps

shape10 (purple):
huge with three layers but almost entirely breakable except for one hard deflecting part in the middle




abilities idea: instead of color determining shape, the color is an identifier of what ability you have.
the shapes are now entirely unrelated to the color
abilities are activated by using the left/right arrow keys 
(being called forward and back due to being reversed when on the opposite side)
back will always taunt, forward will use your ability

white:
press forward to do another taunt

light-blue:
press forward to bump the ball vertically and slow it down a bit

light-green:
press forward to turn 90 degrees clockwise

pink:
press forward to make the ball come to you, maybe increasing speed if already headed towards you

red:
press forward to get closer to the center and maybe increase speed. press again to return to normal

yellow:
press forward for burst of speed in the direction you're holding

dark-blue:
press forward to enable gravity on the ball until next hit

orange:
press forward to disable movement and launch the ball straight ahead horizontally at lightning speed

dark-green:
press forward to make the ball go up a little

purple:
press forward for a short delay before swapping shapes with the opponent
